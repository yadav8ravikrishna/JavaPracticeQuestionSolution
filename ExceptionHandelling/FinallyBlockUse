19) Why it is always recommended that clean up operations like closing the DB resources to keep inside a
 finally block?

Because finally block is always executed whether exceptions are raised in the try block or not and raised
exceptions are caught in the catch block or not. By keeping the clean up operations in finally block, you will
ensure that those operations will be always executed irrespective of whether exception is occurred or not.
