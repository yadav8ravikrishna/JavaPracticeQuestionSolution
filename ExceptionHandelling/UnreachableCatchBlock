9) What is unreachable catch block error?

When we are keeping multiple catch blocks, the order of catch blocks must be from most specific to most
general ones. i.e sub classes of Exception must come first and super classes later. If you keep super classes
first and sub classes later, compiler will show unreachable catch block error.
