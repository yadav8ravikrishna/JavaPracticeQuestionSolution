17) What is the use of throws keyword in Java?

If a method is capable of throwing an exception that it could not handle, then it should specify
that exception using throws keyword. It helps the callers of that method in handling that exception.
The syntax for using throws keyword is,

return_type method_name(parameter_list) throws exception_list
{
     //some statements
}

where, exception_list is the list of exceptions that method may throw. Exceptions must be separated by commas.
