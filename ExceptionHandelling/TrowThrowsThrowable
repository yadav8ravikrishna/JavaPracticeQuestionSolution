22) What is the difference between throw, throws and throwable in Java?

throw is a keyword in java which is used to throw an exception manually. Using throw keyword, you can throw
 an exception from any method or block. But, that exception must be of type java.lang.Throwable class or it’s
 sub classes.

 throws is also a keyword in java which is used in the method signature to indicate that this method may throw
 mentioned exceptions. The caller to such methods must handle the mentioned exceptions either using try-catch
 blocks or using throws keyword

 Throwable is a super class for all types of errors and exceptions in java. This class is a member of java.lang
 package. Only instances of this class or it’s sub classes are thrown by the java virtual machine or by the
 throw statement. The only argument of catch block must be of this type or it’s sub classes. If you want
 to create your own customized exceptions, then your class must extend this class
