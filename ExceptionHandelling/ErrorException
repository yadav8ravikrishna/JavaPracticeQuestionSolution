6) Difference between exception and error.

Errors are mainly caused by the environment in which an application is running.
For example, OutOfMemoryError happens when JVM runs out of memory.
Where as exceptions are mainly caused by the application itself.
For example, NullPointerException occurs when an application tries to access null object.
