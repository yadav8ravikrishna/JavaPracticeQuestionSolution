15) Can we throw an exception manually? If yes, how?

Yes, we can throw an exception manually using throw keyword. Syntax for throwing an exception manually is

throw InstanceOfThrowableType;

Below example shows how to use throw keyword to throw an exception manually.

try
{
    NumberFormatException ex = new NumberFormatException();    //Creating an object to NumberFormatException explicitly

    throw ex;        //throwing NumberFormatException object explicitly using throw keyword
}
catch(NumberFormatException ex)
{
    System.out.println("explicitly thrown NumberFormatException object will be caught here");
}
