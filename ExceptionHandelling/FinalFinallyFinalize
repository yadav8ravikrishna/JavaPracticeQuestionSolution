20) What is the difference between final, finally and finalize in Java?

final is a keyword which is used to make a variable or a method or a class as “unchangeable“. In simple terms,
A variable which is declared as final, it’s value can not be changed once it is initialized.

finally is a block which is used for exception handling along with try and catch blocks.
finally block is always executed whether exception is raised or not and raised exception is handled or not.
Most of time, this block is used to close the resources like database connection, I/O resources etc.

there is one similarity between finally block and finalize() method. Both are used to close the resources used
by the program. finally block is used to close the resources soon after their use. finalize() method is used to
close the resources before an object is removed from the memory. That means if you use finalize() method to
close the resources, they will remain open until an object,  which is using them, is garbage collected.
